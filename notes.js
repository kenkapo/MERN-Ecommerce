6.React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. 
  Routing is the process of managing the URLs of a web application and rendering different components based on the URL. 
  React Router helps you create single-page applications (SPAs) where the content changes dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

7.It's important to note that the <Link> component uses client-side routing to update the URL without causing a full page reload. 
  Anchor tags cause full page reload.

8.The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.

9.The htmlFor property sets or returns the value of the for attribute of a label.

13.You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what. 

14. Post->Create , Get->Read , Put and Patch->Update , Delete->Delete.

15. Reducer is a function in redux where we can change the value of state. They specify how the app's state changes in response to the actions sent to store. (previousState,action)=>new State.

16. An Action in redux is an object with type property. An action creator is a function that returns an action.

17. Redux store is used to Hold app. state, allow access to state via getState(), allows state to be updated via dispatch(action) , registers listeners via subscribe(listener), handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe method.

18. We are also using react form hooks.
